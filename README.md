Monsters Survivors is a bullet-hell game where you kill monsters to gain XP and become more powerful.
Game is built and published by myself using Unity Engine and C#.

The Assets/Scripts/Managements/EnemySpawner.cs script is a script that I am the most proud of because I made a fully configurable enemy spawner depends on the camera resolution. (enemies are spawning outside the camera view and there is a protection from spawning enemies inside environment models)
